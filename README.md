## Description

This project is build on using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript.
It implements DOM manipulation to toggle active classes on HTML elements.

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## Styles

Most of the code here was taken from the skelton code provided by Udacity. This gives the landing page the look and feel that you see and experience. One notable thing is the hover animation on the active navigation header.

## Running
To launch this website, simply clone the repo and open the `index.html` file in the browser.
